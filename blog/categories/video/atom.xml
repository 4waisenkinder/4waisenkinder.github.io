    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I believe our working models and how we collaborate have to change. They
haven&rsquo;t for years. In fact, they haven&rsquo;t changed much since the beginning of
the 20th century: most of us sit in offices, at dedicated desks, participate
in meetings now and then and hope to achive set goals within a reasonable time
span.</p>

<p>Altough there is not solution yet, we&rsquo;re at the verge of dicovering it. Jason
Fried has a radical theory of working: that the office isn&rsquo;t a good place to
do it. He helt an inspiring talk at TEDxMidwest in October 2010.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>[Facebook and Twitter] aren’t the real problems in the office. The real<br/>problems are what I like to call the M&amp;Ms, the Managers and the Meetings.</p></blockquote></p>

<h3>About Jason</h3>

<p>He thinks deeply about collaboration, productivity and the nature of work. At
TEDxMidwest he lays out the main problems (call them the M&amp;Ms) and offers
three suggestions to make work work.</p>

<p>Fried is the co-author of the book Rework, about new ways to conceptualize
working and creating. He is the co-founder and president of
<a href="http://37signals.com/">37signals</a>, a Chicago-based company that builds
webbased productivity tools that, in their words, &ldquo;do less than the
competition &ndash; intentionally.&rdquo; 37signals' simple but powerful collaboration
tools include Basecamp, Highrise, Backpack, Campfire, Ta-da List, and
Writeboard. 37signals also developed and open-sourced the Ruby on Rails
programming framework.</p>
