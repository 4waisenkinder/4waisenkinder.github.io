    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few people may have noticed, that <code>npm install grunt</code> was failing today. According to the pull requests made, it was failing for 10 ( ! ) hours. When you think right know, that this is not a big deal, you probably do not use it in production. Because then it becomes a big problem very quickly.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The reason for failing was a first renamed and later removed dependency of grunt itself. Grunt defines its dependencies ( defined inside of the <code>package.json</code>, if you are not familiar with npm ) with  a <code>~</code> in front of each version number. That is quite common and there is nothing special about it. The <a href="https://npmjs.org/doc/json.html#Tilde-Version-Ranges">tilde</a> defines, that every version greater than the specifed one and less than the next major release is fine to install.</p>

<p>What happened exactly, was that npm was not able to find a version of a particular dependency that fits this conditions ( because of renaming and removing ). And that is it. Nothing special about it, but an important insight.</p>

<p><strong>Whenever we publish something on npm, we have to let it there &ndash; no renaming or removing. There can always be people using it and it can screw up their build!</strong></p>

<p>However, we had to figure out a workaround today quickly, and that is what we did until it was fixed.</p>

<p>We forked grunt at Github. Fixed the dependency problem and set the &ldquo;new&rdquo; grunt as our project dependency. Npm allows you to set dependencies that are not published at npm easily. That can be quiet handy from time to time. ;)</p>

<p><code>
"devDependencies": {
  "grunt": "git://github.com/you/your-grunt-fork.git"
}
</code></p>

<p>Later on there were a few discussions about npm dependency handling on Twitter and <a href="https://twitter.com/asciidisco">@asciidisco</a> pointed me into the direction of <code>npm shrinkwrap</code>.</p>

<p>This command locks all your installed dependencies and writes a new file called <strong>npm-shrinkwrap.json</strong>.</p>

<p>This file is similar to php&rsquo;s <strong>composer.lock</strong> or ruby&rsquo;s <strong>Gemfile.lock</strong>. When you call <code>npm install</code> later on it installs the locked versions written in this file. The version numbers are locked recursively, so that you are safe on production level without any bad surprises.</p>

<p>There can always be a version jump in a dependency, which is quite welcome, but I don&rsquo;t want check out if it works on production side first&hellip;</p>

<p>So the solution is:</p>

<p><strong>Stay with your package.json and define dependencies with &lsquo;>=&rsquo; or &lsquo;~&rsquo; to receive the newest stuff locally, but lock all dependencies for production.</strong></p>

<p>As always opinions and solutions are very welcome about this topic. ;)</p>

    <id>http://4waisenkinder.github.io/blog/2013/06/24/show-npm-statistics-terminal-start</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two month ago I released my <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/cushion-cli">first npm module</a>. I got really excited (and I am still) about releasing something and showing it to the world. Since then the statistics written on top of the module page at NPM are checked by me on a daily basis. Unfortunately these statistics do not seem to be really precise. They are jumping from day to day and should not be taken to serious in my mind (No offense meant. I really like NPM and I think it is a great service).</p>

<p>That is the reason why a friend of mine wrote a <a href="https://raw.github.com/Zoddy/geektool-desk/master/os_downloads.js">tiny script</a> to read the statistics directly from where the data is stored &ndash; a <a href="http://isaacs.iriscouch.com/">CouchDB</a> available for everyone. The script will be part of a <a href="https://github.com/Zoddy/geektool-desk">library for geeky stuff</a> and tools later on, but that is another story.</p>

<p>Today I had the idea about showing this kind of information whenever I open a new terminal window to save some time and &ldquo;pimp my terminal&rdquo;.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I googled a bit and had to notice that it is not to easy to execute scripts on MacOS in the <code>/etc/motd</code> (message of the day). It seems to be much easier in the linux world &ndash; correct me when I&rsquo;m wrong please. ;)</p>

<p>So I decided to execute the whole stuff inside of the shell configuration files placed in the given user root (information about NPM modules are probably user related, so after a bit of thinking I like that solution even more).</p>

<p>To start you have to clone the Github project with the mentioned script (in my case <code>~/Sites/</code>).</p>

<p><code>
git clone https://github.com/Zoddy/geektool-desk.git
</code></p>

<p>After that we start editing the .bash_profile, .bashrc, .zshrc or whatever shell file your system and shell gives you.</p>

<p>I prefer using ZSH. Adding the following lines does all the magic for me &ndash; look at this <a href="https://github.com/Zoddy/geektool-desk">readme</a> for further explanation how to use the script. This example is made for my &lsquo;cushion-cli&rsquo; project. I think you are not interested in this data, so please feel free to change it to your project names.</p>

<p>```</p>

<h3>show cushion-cli downloads</h3>

<p>echo &ldquo;\nCUSHION-CLI DOWNLOADS\n&rdquo;</p>

<p>echo &ldquo;TODAY / YESTERDAY:&rdquo;
today=$(node /Users/stefan/Sites/geektool-desk/os_downloads.js cushion-cli today)
yesterday=$(node /Users/stefan/Sites/geektool-desk/os_downloads.js cushion-cli yesterday)
printf &ldquo;%s / %s downloads\n\n&rdquo; &ldquo;$today&rdquo; &ldquo;$yesterday&rdquo;</p>

<p>echo &lsquo;CURRENT WEEK / LAST WEEK:&rsquo;
week=$(node /Users/stefan/Sites/geektool-desk/os_downloads.js cushion-cli current-week)
last_week=$(node /Users/stefan/Sites/geektool-desk/os_downloads.js cushion-cli last-week)
printf &ldquo;%s / %s downloads\n\n&rdquo; &ldquo;$week&rdquo; &ldquo;$last_week&rdquo;</p>

<p>echo &lsquo;CURRENT MONTH / LAST MONTH:&rsquo;
month=$(node /Users/stefan/Sites/geektool-desk/os_downloads.js cushion-cli current-month)
last_month=$(node /Users/stefan/Sites/geektool-desk/os_downloads.js cushion-cli last-month)
printf &ldquo;%s / %s downloads\n\n&rdquo; &ldquo;$month&rdquo; &ldquo;$last_month&rdquo;
```</p>

<p>I am not a shell script wizard. If something is not correct with these lines let me know.</p>

<p>And that is the result. Hope you enjoy it.</p>
