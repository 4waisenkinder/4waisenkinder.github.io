TL;DR:
------
Jason Fried has a radical theory of working: that the office isn't a good place to do it.

I believe our working models and how we collaborate have to change. They haven't for years. In fact, they haven't changed much since the beginning of the 20th century: most of us sit in offices, at dedicated desks, participate in meetings now and then and hope to achive set goals within a reasonable time span.

Altough there is not solution yet, we're at the verge of dicovering it. Jason Fried from 37signals held an inspiring talk at TEDxMidwest in October 2010.

[Facebook and Twitter] arenâ€™t the real problems in the office. The real problems are what I like to call the M&Ms, the Managers and the Meetings.

### About Jason

He thinks deeply about collaboration, productivity and the nature of work. At TEDxMidwest he lays out the main problems (call them the M&Ms) and offers three suggestions to make work work.

Fried is the co-author of the book Rework, about new ways to conceptualize working and creating. He is the co-founder and president of [37signals](http://37signals.com/), a Chicago-based company that builds web-based productivity tools that, in their words, "do less than the competition - intentionally." 37signals' simple but powerful collaboration tools include Basecamp, Highrise, Backpack, Campfire, Ta-da List, and Writeboard. 37signals also developed and open-sourced the Ruby on Rails programming framework.
